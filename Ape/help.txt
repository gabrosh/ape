Text area and Prompt area commands ---------------------------------------------

p = applicable also in prompt modes
s = works also with Shift modifier
r = works also with register prefix

The default register is ", the operating system's clipboard register is '.

For commands that store selections into register, uppercase register name causes
the selections to be appended to the register slots. For commands that load content
from register, uppercase register name causes each of the register slots to give
the same content - the contents of all register slots joined together using new line
character.

Symbol registers are treated as uppercase when prefixed with " instead of '.

For system's clipboard register ', after every command that stores selections into
register, all register slots - joined together using new line character - are copied
to the clipboard, and before every command that loads content from register, the
clipboard is copied to the first register slot.

Keys recording is toggled by <c-q>, recorded keys are stored in register . .

In Search, Select, Keep and Discard prompts, .NET regular expressions are used.
Multi-line and single-line regular expressions specified by (?m) and (?s) options are
supported with a reasonable limit as to the count of lines held in the processing buffer.
In Search, named groups (?<name>...) and (?'name'...) are colored by distinct colors
according to the first letter of group's name. Colors for a lowercase letter differ
from those for the corresponding uppercase letter.

Command arguments --------------------------------------------------------------

Command arguments are separated by space character.

If you need to include space character in an argument, enclose the argument into
a pair of ". In such argument, \ serves as an escape character. \" represents ",
\\ represents \ and \t represents tab character. Other pairs are not supported.

If you want to include space character in an argument without the need to escape all
occurences of \, enclose the argument into a pair of " prefixed by @. In such argument,
" can be represented by "".

Examples: "Hello, \"world\"!"
          @"Hello, ""world""!"


Settings -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scopes: global buffer extract

"global" scope inherits the default settings, "buffer" scope inherits from "global"
scope and "extract" scope (only for extract buffers) inherits from "buffer" scope.
When unspecified, the command is applied on the most local scope ("buffer" or "extract").

scope and "extract" scope (only for extract buffers) inherits from "buffer" scope.
When unspecified, the command is applied on the most local scope ("buffer" or "extract").

In map and unmap commands, key can be a single key or a "key prefix and key" pair.
Key prefix can be one of <c-b>, <c-e>, <c-B>, <c-E>, <sc-b>, <sc-e>.

Examples: a, <c-b>a, <c-B>a, <sc-b>a
