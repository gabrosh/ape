# ape
Minimalistic modal text editor in F#

The editor was strongly inspired by Vim and Kakoune text editors.

It's intended to be used as a Swiss knife for structural text editing and analyzing log or trace files. It's not a replacement for IDE or any established text editor you use today.

Ape can be build for Windows and Linux.
For the best experience on Windows Ape should be run in Windows Terminal.
On Linux, you will probably have to remap all key bindings with Ctrl modifier to something else as Linux console practically doesn't support key bindings with Ctrl modifier.
You can get a single Ape executable file accompanied by the basic configuration files and the help file by publishing the Ape project - for example, in Visual Studio. 

Press F1 in Normal mode or run :help command (or :h) for help. To get back into Normal mode from whereever you are, press Esc.

Happy experimenting!
